# simpleJavaPrograms
This repository contains simple java programs which I wrote while studying basics of programming during course IT v Kurze.
We use these programs to practise basic commands in java such as cycles (for, while, do-while), conditions (if, switch-case), drawing star patterns.
There are programs like simple calculator, drawing star patterns, Fibonacci sequence, list odd numbers and another approximately 15 simple java programs.
All of them were written in IntellijIDEA.
